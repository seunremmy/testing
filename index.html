                <h2>Osesusi Seun</h2>
                <p>Tchouameni had been scouted extensively, going back to his days as a youth-team player at Bordeaux, and his age, potential and ability to play as both a No.6 and a No.8 made him an ideal candidate, especially with Borussia Dortmund having made it clear that the Reds’ other ‘gun’ target, Jude Bellingham, would not be sold that summer.

                    Initial discussions with the players’ representatives were encouraging, with Liverpool not put off by Monaco’s demands for a deal which, with add-ons included, would total close to €100 million (£89m/$106m).
                    
                    The Reds, aware that Sadio Mane wanted to leave, knew they would need to sign a forward and had already earmarked Benfica’s Darwin Nunez, but they were willing to splash out on Tchouameni too, with the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keita likely to then be moved on to create space and generate funds.</p>
